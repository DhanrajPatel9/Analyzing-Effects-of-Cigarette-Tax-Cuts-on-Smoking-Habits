Within this report we will investigate how the 1994 decrease of cigarette taxes in select provinces effected peoples smoking habits and analyze how their smoking patterns fluctuated within a year.

Within this report we will investigate how the 1994 decrease of cigarette taxes in select provinces effected
peoples smoking habits and analyze how their smoking patterns fluctuated within a year. We will use a
survey conducted by Statistics Canada on a diverse group of smokers who were surveyed every three months
for a year starting after the tax decrease. We used this data on a frequentist Poisson model and Bayesian
(prior: Gamma, likelihood: Poisson) model to estimate the average number of cigarettes smoked by the
survey participants in a day and week. Also, by using a Linear regression model we examined the how the
total number of cigarettes smoked by all the participants varied throughout the survey. All three models
showed similar results with an increase in the daily/weekly averages and total number of cigarettes smoked
in the first three months of the survey; however, resulted in a decrease in the usage of cigarette in the last
nine months. Despite the decrease in the smoking prevalence seen within the survey, the rate at which the
smoking prevalence decreased did not reach the rate of provinces who did not lower the tax rate. From this,
we conclude that decreasing the taxes on cigarettes slows down the decline in smoking rates by incentivizing
people to smoke cigarettes by making them more affordable and accessible.
